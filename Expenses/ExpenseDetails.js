//1)Can you also create a component called ExpenseDetails which has the title and the amount of Expenses
//2) Your Expense Item return function should only have the following after that

/*function ExpenseDetails(props){
  

return(
    <div className='expense-item'>

    <h2>{props.title} </h2>
    

    <div className='expense-item__price'>${props.amount}</div>
    </div>
);
}

export default ExpenseDetails;*/
